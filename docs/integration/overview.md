# Integrations Overview: GitLab, GitHub, and Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP)

Reva‚Äôs platform enables **centralized policy management** by integrating with **GitLab**, **GitHub**, and **Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP)**. Each integration supports a different phase of the policy lifecycle:

- **GitLab and GitHub**: Used for distributing policies authored in Reva via version-controlled repositories.  
- **AVP**: Used for real-time policy enforcement with full lifecycle management from within Reva.

These integrations allow Reva to combine **developer-friendly workflows** with **cloud-scale policy enforcement**.
