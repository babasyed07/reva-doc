# Welcome to Reva Governance and Authorization Platform

Reva is a comprehensive governance and authorization platform designed to simplify, centralize, and secure access control across modern applications. Built to support fine-grained, policy-based authorization, Reva enables organizations to define, manage, and enforce who can access what, when, and under what conditions. By integrating seamlessly with environments like Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP), GitHub, and GitLab, it bridges the gap between policy creation and distribution. Reva’s declarative model leverages Cedar-based schemas and policies to support dynamic, contextual access decisions tailored to real-world business scenarios.

Beyond access enforcement, Reva serves as a robust governance layer with built-in version control, test data validation, policy lifecycle tracking, and audit trails. Administrators can onboard applications, define environments, map entity relationships, and simulate access outcomes—all from a unified interface. With visual tools like access maps, hierarchical schema builders, and real-time status dashboards, Reva empowers both developers and security teams to collaborate on access governance. Whether managing internal tools or external-facing services, Reva ensures that access is transparent, traceable, and policy-driven at scale.
