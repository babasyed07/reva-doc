# 🗂️ **Category Management**

Category Management is a critical feature in Reva's platform that allows administrators to define and organize high-level classifications, such as Healthcare, Retail, or Enterprise. These categories typically reflect the sector or industry the organizationoperateswithin and serve as the top-level entity in the application hierarchy. Categorizing applications in this way improves structure, scalability, and governance.This central management capability ensures that applications can be logically grouped and filtered based on organizational relevance.

To access Category Management, begin by clicking the Settings icon located in the left sidebar of the main navigation menu.Once the settings panel expands, select Category Management from the list of options. This action will take you to the main Category Management screen, where you can view existing categories, create new ones, and manage category details effectively.
